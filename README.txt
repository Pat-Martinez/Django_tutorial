myproject is my first Django project from the Django Project website, tutorial 1 (creating an
application named polls.  There is one naming convention that I used differently than the 
tutorial.  In the tutorial the project is named "mysite" and I named mine "myproject".

The link to the tutorial:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/

I had trouble using django-admin.py to access the shell and to run the server (runserver).
To circumvent this I used manage.py to run these commands.
